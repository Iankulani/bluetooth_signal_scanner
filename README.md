# bluetooth_signal_scanner
This MATLAB-based cybersecurity tool allows you to scan for nearby Bluetooth devices, capture their signal strength (RSSI), and visualize the data with a bar chart. You can modify or extend the script to include more advanced features like detecting unknown Bluetooth devices, logging data, or monitoring signal strength over time.
